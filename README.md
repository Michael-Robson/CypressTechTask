# Things I would improve with more time

- Get 4 products accross different pages so check for pagination if it's more than 1 switch pages and add products from page 2 etc
- Check all items added have a different price
- More checks on every page
- Move the hardcoded intercept URLS to fixtures or have them as GitHub / AWS secrets so we would have them in a secure location
